"Given an inclination of the line as 60 degrees, find the slope of the line<img>1</img>",4,0.87,1,-6,60,2,Identify the angle made between the line and the X axis. Check the figure and see if you can find the angle,The value of slope of the line = tan (inclination in degrees or radians),The inclination is 60 degrees and hence the slope is tan(60),7,1,The value of slope is tan (inclination) and not sin (inclination) [or cos (inclination)],Your answer is correct! Let's try the next one,You seem to have misinterpreted the inclination. The right answer is 1,The selected answer is the value inclination and not slope. Value of slope = tan (inclination)
Which of these figures represent a line with slope as -12/7: ,4,<img>2_1</img>,<img>2_3</img>,<img>2_0</img>,<img>2_2</img>,3,Identify the angle made between the line and the X axis. Check the figure and see if you can find the angle,The value of slope of the line = tan (inclination in degrees or radians),If the value of slope = 1 then the value of inclination should be either 45 degrees (or \/4c) or 225 degrees (or 5\/4c),7,1,The value of inclination is such that the line falls in the first quadrant hence the value of slope i.e tan (inclination) cannot be negative,The line described is not of the type y = b and intersects the Y axis as can be visibly seen. Hence your answer is incorrect,Your answer is correct! Let's try the next one,The line described is not of the type x = a and intersects the X axis as can be visibly seen. Hence your answer is incorrect
"Given an inclination of the line as 135 degrees, find the slope of the line<img>3</img>",4,-1,-1.73,135,-0.71,1,Identify the angle made between the line and the X axis.,The value of slope of the line = tan (inclination in degrees or radians),The inclination is 135 degrees and hence the slope is tan(135),7,1,Your answer is correct! Let's try the next one,You seem to have misinterpreted the inclination. The right answer is -1,The selected answer is the value inclination and not slope. Value of slope = tan (inclination),The value of slope is tan (inclination) and not sin (inclination) [or cos (inclination)]
